Hello, my name is Elodie and I am a junior developer based in Minnesota. I do mainly freelance Front-End Web Development at the moment but I also love other types of programming like software development and robotics. All of my repositories for Web Dev are labled with the domain name and are in my organization ["Synthia Technologies"](https://github.com/Synthia-Technologies). Each of the sites are the products of weeks of making sure my client is able to be completely satisfied with the website that they end up with. I am very big on making sure that the client takes part in each step of the way, from designing to hosting I make it as transparent as I can exactly what I am doing.
